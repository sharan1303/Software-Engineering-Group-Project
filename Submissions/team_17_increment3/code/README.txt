The application requires Java 11 and JavaFX 11.0.2.
A precompiled JAR of this submission is included, which allows it to be run without compiling.
This is run with the following command:

	java --module-path {JAVAFX-SDK} --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar .\increment2.jar

Where {JAVAFX-SDK} should be replaced with the path to JavaFX (usually javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib).
