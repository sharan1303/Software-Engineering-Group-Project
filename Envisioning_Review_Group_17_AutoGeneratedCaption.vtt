we should make it something

a040bacd-20d4-4c60-9f96-cfa196b6290c
00:52:56.321 --> 00:52:57.717
that's much more basic.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.904
So for example something similar to scratch,

2706fcd6-7cac-4dda-9dd9-30765e99982e
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:02.376
where you might have a drag and drop system

54c39cd1-d6bb-40c3-b2b9-697092ca3dab
00:53:02.376 --> 00:53:04.915
or something that's a bit more advanced,

just simple kind of drag and drop

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.760
so I think if you reach an agreement

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:45.520
